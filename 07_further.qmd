## Acknowledgements  

We are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for funding the Discovery and Prototyping phases of the development of DigiCAT. Our thanks also go to the many who contributed to DigiCAT in various ways. We are grateful to the young person advisory groups (YPAGs) who provided invaluable insights and help guide the direction of DigiCAT, to the users who responded to our user survey and to the group members who provided feedback on iterations of the tool.
