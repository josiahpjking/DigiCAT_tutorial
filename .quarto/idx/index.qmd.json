The tutorials provide information on what counterfactual analysis is, why it can be useful, and how to do it using DigiCAT. These pages are designed to be accessible to those with minimal experience of counterfactual analysis.

If you are already confident in your knowledge of counterfactual analysis and know which approach you would like to implement you can go directly to the relevant tutorial sections for information on how it is implemented in DigiCAT. There are specific sections for currently implemented methods, which are: propensity score analysis (with 1:1 and k:1 matching), propensity score weighting, and non-bipartite propensity score analysis. All of these method can be used with survey design variables and with either multiple imputation, weighting, or complete case analysis to deal with missing data. These also have their own sections in the tutorials.  \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n## Overview of tutorials\n\nWelcome to the tutorial pages for DigiCAT!
